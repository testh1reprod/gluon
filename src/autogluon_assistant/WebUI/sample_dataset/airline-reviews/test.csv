The flight looked good and well maintained 777. Inflight entertainment was good and updated to latest movies, documentaries, talk shows 5* for that. The seating space was just about good enough. Be careful of the head set it can get in the way and snap. The air conditioner was not up to the mark so it was warm in the cabin. The inflight food was extremely hot, in short it was burnt. The answer from the flight crew when someone asked for a second helping of 150ml coke can is that they needed to keep stock for the return flight.

My wife, my son (4) and me all flew BA Euro Club on our way to Alicante, for some reason when booking Club it was the same price as normal so it was a no brainer. My son has autism so we found the quite lounge amazing way to start our trip as he was very calm before. The staff at BA were very friendly before and on the plane which was a nice touch.

160,1.0,"""most appalling airline service""",C Peale,8th May 2023,True,"I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways.

Nice champagne and a nice quiet ambiance which I like. The place is starting to show signs of wear and tear - with sagging seat cushions. Plane was latest 1st Class and there was only 7 passengers including my wife and I. It seemed a little larger than the 1st I travelled on a month ago on an A380. Maybe it was because of the hideous centre console (that houses he folding table) was smaller - rather than take up half the space. To start we had a small ""appetizer"" (an Amuse Bouche) which was absolutely hideous. A sort of grilled cheese with burnt bits on it and some sort of couscous. It was foul and we left the lot. Both had a langoustine starter which was ok. The mushrooms with it was wet and horrible texture to the mouth. The soup we both had was nice. My cod dish was very good. My wife said the steak two ways was ok. The braised part she did not eat. Wines all ok. Service from the FAs was fine. In terms of overall quality BA really fail consistently to deliver. As a matter of curiosity I sourced the on way price the day before we left; £5543 - one way. Its an insane price and if I paid that I would be furious as to the product I experienced. Travelling in 1st is only worth it on ""sale"" offers or Avios. We are travelling back in Club as in my experienced the slightly shorter flight home in First is not worth the money or the Avios.

3591,6.0,British Airways customer review,Ian Robinson,16th June 2014,False,LGW - Paphos 4th June. Check in and fast track security was very easy and we were airside within 5 minutes. As we were flying at 2.45 we decided to have some lunch in the lounge. The lounge was busy but there was still plenty of space to relax. The food options were poor to say the least with soup sandwiches or ham salad being the only items on offer. My wife who is a vegetarian was not impressed as she had to make do with an egg mayonnaise sandwich. Having been told when we checked in that the flight was 'bang on time' the screen informed us at 2.05 that we should proceed to gate 101. After a 10 minute stroll we arrived at the gate to be told there was a delay to the flight. Why on earth this information could not have been passed through to the lounge is a mystery. No pre flight drinks were offered and we eventually took off about an hour late. Pre lunch drinks were served after 40 minutes and then lunch about 30 minutes after that. The crew were very nice but rather stressed and mentioned that the plane (737-400) should not have been used on this route. My wife had pre ordered a veggie meal that was not loaded on the plane but the very nice but stressed FA said she could have hers. It was a nice gesture but my wife felt slightly guilty about taking it although she did and enjoyed her meal. I was told that there was only one option left for me and I could have Kedgeree or Kedgeree so that's what I had. It was OK but not particularly hot. Arrived at Paphos about 45 minutes late with our priority luggage being in the last 6 cases to arrive on the carousel. Overall the flight was just OK although if it had not been for the excellent cabin crew it would have been disappointing. My wife did receive an email from BA within 2 days of our arrival saying they had let her down with the non arrival of her pre ordered food on this flight and apologised which is fare enough.,,Business Class,,,3.0,4.0,,3.0,no,,3.0,1.0,
877,7.0,"""an old style business class experience""",David Ellis,27th May 2019,True,"CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule.

Also finding out meals are being stopped in economy and you can only pay with Avios or card this has in my opinion put a great name into the league of of other cheap airlines. How sad but clearly someone in charge (at the moment) is feeling smug and feels that is going to improve customer choice. Why do you think people chose British Airways? As they are more expensive?

Silly me. The queue was ridiculous for bag drop and I had to spend over 2 hours waiting to drop my bag! The queue for assisted check in was far quicker – I think that things got inverted now. Maybe quicker to check in at the airport? So I was hoping to have had time to eat before the flight. British Airways were completely under staffed and disorganised. There were no signs of people trying to indicate where we should go considering the massive queues. Total fail. I felt I was flying with a low cost airline. I kept checking the flight details for any planned delays - it was obvious that it was going to be massively delayed because of snow, etc, but the monitor and alerts were indicating departure at 10.22 instead of the planned departure at 10.00. Well, that was the case until 5 minutes before 10.22! Finally we got 'updated'. I doubt that this was only known at that time. Why wasn't there an update before? Anyway, new departure time scheduled for 11.59. We only started boarding at 11.00. Then, inside the cabin, we waited for another hour until taking off. At no point did BA offer vouchers. We only ate inside the cabin after 2am. The flight was terrible but that's another story. I see no point at flying with BA (for a few years now). Staff are old and 'entitled'. When you are not lucky enough to fly in a modern aircraft, you are presented with filthy dirty seats. Food getting worse and worse, and in board entertaining – almost non-existent.

Pretty uninspiring stuff. On board comfortable, if narrow, seats that extended into (more or less) flat beds.

3298,2.0,British Airways customer review,Clive V Drake,17th November 2014,False,LAX/LHR. The flight started badly with the lounge facilities (or lack of) at LAX. There is no First Class lounge anymore – and worst still its a communal Business/First facility shared by BA Qantas and Cathay Pacific. Two hours before my flight it was a zoo. Rammed with around 300 passengers from 3 flights. The food and beverages was to a very high standard. There was no separated boarding lines for First passengers. Flight left on time and dinner was an ordinary affair. A poached salmon starter was neither here or there. Luke warm soup. A rather nice but not exceptional Italian style chicken dish. All served with cheap canteen style cutlery - long gone is the nice silver-plated cutlery they used to offer. Wines were fine. Turn down bed service reminded me of why I don't like the new BA First class seat. The silliest aspect has to be that you either have a seat or a bed – and no adjustable foot rest. In bed mode and mainly thanks to the design of the centre console housing the table - the bed is to narrow. I am 6 4” tall and not overweight. It's very awkward and uncomfortable. BA in old first I am sure use to give you a foldable mattress – now they don't. You get a thin duvet. This makes the bed incredible hard; and during turbulence its a hard uncomfortable to ride. I don't think I slept more than an hour in the whole flight. The tight confines of the compartment means you have to be a gymnast to get in and out when in bed mode. This fare is sometimes as much as £7000 – one way and it's not worth it. What amazes me in the competitive world that BA operate is that they don't seem to look at the competition. They trumpet they are the best and yet they are not. Mind you on the LAX route the only alternative is AA – and they have little ideas on quality in First Class. When I look at what SIA Emirates (the best in my view) and Etihad offer BA do not come close. BA often charge more than anyone else for a frequently inferior product. In fact over the last ten years the prices have sky-rocketed and the quality and standards have sky rocketed as well - downwards!,,First Class,,,1.0,4.0,,2.0,no,,2.0,2.0,

For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each.

But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation.

When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job.

Cabin crew very apologetic and blamed management for recent cost cutting measures, saying this is happening a lot and upsetting many passengers.

Complained to Customer Service after arriving home and was told the caterer at LHR was to blame and they didn't want to delay the flight waiting for the extra meals. Seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew said. Crew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my children which was highly appreciated.

We arrived very early at the airport in Kuala Lumpur to catch a flight to London in premium economy. They would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why. The flight was massively overbooked. There are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10. There was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. This is utterly irresponsible. Very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. We were told by the manager that this happens almost every night. Not a single employee of British Airways was there to manage the situation. It was left to the poor Malaysia Airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. They have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer. They refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation.

To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways.

As we were there around 09.15 I had hoped to have a hot breakfast but in the end the only hot dish available was porridge which I didn't fancy so we settled for tea and cakes. The departure gate was not the biggest and as a result it all got a bit messy with the staff trying coral the CW passengers in to a separate area to board first. On board most things were OK and the staff are very efficient and helped to make the experience a good one. The return from Kingston was pretty much the same although the check in was slower. However this was compensated by an excellent lounge (Club Kingston) that served nice hot and cold snacks and then escorted you to the departure area.

The decor looks like it was directly taken out of the 1980 film Airplane! You still get the odd knock on the legs when economy passengers are boarding then plane with hand luggage as there is no private space! Staff were fine but flying business class a customer should get a wow factor - and there was none. The plastic translucent slider that divides the seats had been battered from being shifted up and down when the crew serve the food and drinks. The toilets are exactly the same as economy except in Business class they stick a plastic flower in a glass. The food was OK but again nothing special.

Noticeably, this year that service has become far more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience on this recent flight to Malta ex Gatwick. Departure time was 0750 and we arrived at Premium Check-in at 0620 to find only one member of staff manning the desks serving First and Club. There were at least 10 parties waiting in the queue, some of whom defected to Economy desks which were heavily manned with faster moving queues. Only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the Check-in lady left much to be desired - robotic, unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description. It would have been good to have been informed that the No 1 Lounge was available in the absence of the BA offering, but no mention of a lounge was made at all. The No 1 Lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load, but that is another story. Boarding was fine, but the in-flight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best. The meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered until after all meals had been dispensed. Clearing the meal was even worse. The flight was in final approach to Luqa when, returning from the toilet, I saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her I-pad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the Captain announced ""cabin crew to seats for landing"". Should I have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this lady's games session?

The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks.

Onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats, duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. Staff friendly and accommodating, cabin (upper deck- A380) clean and comfortable. My next trip in August was last minute with just First available. I felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. My past experiences with First prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- I felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. So, with all the changes in First now, I thought I would really be in for a relaxing treat. I want to preface this by saying I have always loved British Airways and has always been my first choice for London- Houston, JFK-London flights for years. I had a early flight. Checked in in ample time before my flight. I went straight to the Concorde Room to have breakfast. What I was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. There was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. I met an English couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. It all went downhill from there. The wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. I carried some dishes to the front just so I could be seated. Boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. It looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. The the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. He offered a Men's toiletry kit and a Business Class kit. The food was served. I started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and I am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. Then the entrees were short and I had to choose a second choice. Any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting I paid for First and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  Business Class wins out hands down. The food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. The Pilot did come out and asked if BA could call me and he was very apologetic (I guess a Steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - I consented. Disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. It left me feeling that BA really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. My flight back to JFK I flew Business. It was comfortable. Though there was less space in First class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious.

I have complained to BA and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn't in the future. Next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight. My IFE didnt work, they offered to move me, ironically to swap with one of the BA employees but I declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife.

The unique forward facing/rear facing seat configuration fits in more seats than other leading airlines. Try to get a window/aisle seat if you are travelling as a couple but you will be lucky unless you are prepared to pay £60 to choose your seat. Otherwise you will be allocated a seat 24 hours before the flight and there are limited choices to change your seat allocation on a busy flight. In the middle 4 seats you will be either facing someone during service take off and landing or sat next to someone with a small partition between you. In all seats the foot rest is part of the bed and blocks access so you will either have to step over or be stepped over to leave your seat. The seats were comfortable in all positions. Dinner was average but less elegant than meals on other leading airlines. Breakfast was a disaster; hardly any of the choices on the menu were available but no explanation or apology were offered which was typical of the functional unsmiling flight attendants.

I understand that because of the row, both the table and screen were in the arm rests, but by the time I had used a cardigan and the blanket to pad out the arm rests (very hard on the elbows) I felt very cramped.

Breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge - yuk. The British Airways check in staff at Newark are so surly and miserable. Whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that I could not distinguish what she was saying.

On leaving Dublin the pilot opined that it was a good day to fly! On reaching LHR we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to be diverted to Gatwick and were running out of fuel. In summary we sat on the tarmac at Gatwick for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for LHR and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. On reaching LHR BA staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights. I was lucky as I managed to get on my flight to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific but with only moments to spare after a dash to terminal 3. Whilst I understand the volatility of the weather the real point of my review is that BA appears to have abandoned the basics of customer service and this is clearly reflected in BA's absence in the top 10 airline ratings.

Water or orange was offered prior to take off along with a hot towel. We pushed back from the stand at exactly our departure time and were airborne about 10 minutes later. I can't say the seats were the most comfortable I have ever sat on but the extra leg room in PE did help. Two drinks rounds were served one before and one with lunch. The food was just about OK although I never have any great expectations so I am rarely disappointed. However the size and picture quality of the TV screens was very poor and as a result I decided to read for most of the journey.

Our booked flight to San Francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back.

The British Airways website is unreliable and prone to returning baffling errors even when carrying out the simplest of activities. Its upgrade path is impenetrable and designed to confuse, call centre staff do not seem to speak English and make ridiculous requests and ground staff are didactic. Examples: Cannot check in online, but via the app on a smartphone, no problem (except I wanted a printed boarding pass). Call centre staff in India wanted to speak to my 5 year old daughter when my family accompanied me one one trip, as she was on a different booking and wouldn't give me her flight reference number ""for security reasons"". No problem with ""security reasons"" when I paid BA a lot of money for the ticket. Upgrading with points or Avios fails in the middle of a transaction. The system remains unavailable to check you in for some time after, so you have to call the call centre. BA blacks out so many flights from purchasing with Avios, it's not worth trying unless you're jobless and can fly any time, and don't care where you go. In the queue for boarding my passport wasn't open at the right page and the staff at the gate admonished me as a result. On another occasion at passport control after checking in I was directed back to the BA desk I'd just come from. ""There's nothing wrong with your passport, it must be BAA. It's not us"", was the response. It took a huffing, tutting, BA duty manager to run the visa check again. I advise people to avoid BA if possible. The only reason for choosing BA is flight safety.

Thereafter no matter how many times I pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. No offers of cognac or liqueurs. Dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. When I say over-cooked I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant.

My boarding card said the gate closed at 1840, and when I hadn't heard any announcement by 1830 I asked the BA man at reception if there was a delay. I was very dismayed when he casually said ""yes, about 1 hour 30 mins"". I was very unhappy they had not told us earlier, or asked if we needed help getting home in a more timely manner. There was a time when BA would have tried to reroute its premium passengers, but this man told me his duty manager had specifically told him not to do this. He told me that if I wanted to switch to an earlier LHR or LCY flight I would have to go back landside and buy a ticket for those flights. Onboard I had my first experience of BA's new club Europe, wherein the middle seat is covered by a tray, to give the perception of more space, without actually giving you a wider seat or more legroom. From my experiences of BA business class in both long and short haul, over the past year, it is very sad to see that BA is focussing on making changes which make it more money, rather than changes which benefit the passenger experience. My meal was plonked down in front of me without telling me what it was, and it wasn't at all tasty.

The long haul flight was OK - food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was OK for an economy class flight. However, it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning - so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight. I wasn't too fussed about that, until I got on my connecting flight to Edinburgh where I found out that they no longer served free food! By this point, I was pretty hungry so I caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll, which never happened because the trolly never reached me! To top it all off, we left Heathrow late because of a computer problem, meaning I missed my train connection in Edinburgh - but I understand that these things happen at times.

United rebooked me onto British Airways to complete the flight to Boston. Without a doubt, BA is one of the worst airlines I have flown on. Upon arriving at check in, I was told that I could only check in one bag, despite being allowed to take two bags on United. United said that I would be able to travel on an equivalent service with BA. The check in supervisor at Heathrow informed me that I would have to pay £65 to bring the bag. When I complained said ""it's not my problem"". I asked if they could call United to clarify the bag issue, but they refused, saying ""we don't even talk to United"" - in the end I didn't pay and will get it sent at a later date. The onboard service was very disappointing. The food was barely edible. The staff were loud and abrupt, providing the bare minimum service and yelling across the cabin at each other making the whole journey even more unpleasant. The inflight entertainment failed multiple times, and passengers started to be reseated because of the problem. The maximum volume was also too low so it was difficult to hear the movies over the cabin noise, and I am not hard of hearing.

I think this is one of BA's main let-downs. The inflight entertainment was slightly disappointing. There wasn't a single movie that I fancied but then I suppose everyone has different tastes. I did listen to some music though. The service on board was generally good at least on the side of the aircraft I was on. The stewardess who served was very kind and attentive. The food was good although I got a sense that something was missing from the meal overall. It wasn't highly appealing. I also find the seats comfortable they are softer than those on Singapore Airlines. I slept very well and I'm not usually one to sleep particularly well on flights.

After the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan I left it for a few months. On calling yesterday they told me that I had accepted the changes as it was months ago I told her that the other agent suggested that I wait and decide later. This was followed by the fact that I had purchased a cabin bag only fare, but I travel with a iPad or laptop, with the recent electronics ban BA were going to force me to pay £50 for a bag to check my device. Although this was not my fault. To add to this everything is paid for now, reduced legroom, pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in, I can see no reason to fly BA any longer.

I didnt think it could get worse but it did. Arrived at the airport and my app said on time, screens said on time but my independent tracking app said 3 hours delay. In the first class lounge I was told short delay. Knowing how inaccurate BA can be I asked to speak to special services. One hour later I asked again. I got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty, take it up with Alex Cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity. Unimportant is how I felt after 25 years of Gold guest list. She then told me the flight was cancelled and said I would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .Staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for Charles De Gaulle no alternative was offered. I had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg BA for a refund which they tried to sidestep. The moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at BA it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the CEO. The other interesting fact is I did look at choices before booking including Easy jet <100 pounds Air France 500 pounds and foolishly I felt loyalty meant something. Not at this airlin . The salt in the wound is that Easyjet and AF got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in France.

I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad.

I find myself nodding in agreement to many of the reviews written here by other passengers regarding the slippage in standards of BA especially considering what they once were. Having arrived at Dulles in good time to check in there were paper notices on the desk to say that check in would not open 'til 5.00 pm. Okay it was Christmas Day but all other carriers both domestic and international were open (the airport was busy) and I along with other passengers had to sit and wait for 1.5 hrs until staff arrived. The same was true of the lounge which having made it through security was not open 'til 6.30 pm. Again the other airline lounges were open. Having eventually gained access the lounge was great and the bar and dinner service (I was on a sleeper flight) were very good with plentiful drinks and fine food. We boarded on time and my seat was upstairs on the A380. This aircraft is of course huge but the Club World seat is as many have noted much less comfortable than the Boeing 777 or 747. It is narrower and whilst okay for seating very hard and difficult to find the right position for sleeping. BA seem to have missed a great opportunity here to do something really special along the lines of some of the Asian carriers. The crew were very good - friendly and attentive. Breakfast before we landed was very average. The bacon rolls were dried out and are always a challenge to eat. Yoghurt and fruit were the alternatives which I went for. Check in for the return journey was lamentable at Heathrow Terminal 5. Dedicated Club World positions had queues around ten people deep and moved terribly slowly. Not all the positions were open and passengers were visibly irritated. The journey other than the cramped seat issue again was fine with another good crew and food and drinks. I have always recommended BA to friends and would like to keep doing so but feel that especially given the high and rising cost of paying for Club these days BA need to adopt a slightly less 'take' attitude and give a little more especially when it comes to spending Avios which they are very keen for one to accrue but reticent to allow one to use.,,Business Class,,,2.0,4.0,,3.0,yes,,4.0,4.0,

I arrived 2 hours before departure at Heathrow Terminal 3 and couldn't quite understand what was going on; the queue to actually drop my pre-checked luggage was long, very long, hearing customers complaining they were standing in line for a good hour, and that there were no signs of BA taking any steps to remedy the situation. Even with my frantic tweeting at BA, nothing improved. The situation boiled down to the fact that only 4 desks were open for the general public on the day that schools finished. Needless to say, whoever was in charge that day didn't really know what they were doing and caused a lot of agro for many customers, and BA needs to take full responsibility of this. Once these proceedings had passed, I found myself boarding the Boeing 747-400 which was tired and not very well maintained. Leg room was atrociously tight, with a metal support for the seat in front of me limiting the actual usable legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good selection of films, but was made to be disappointing with the meagre 7"" to 9"" screens. The staff was very friendly. Looking after our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best to find some people seconds if they were left hungry after the meal. The meal was decent, not fantastic.  My only note when it comes to food and drink is that more water should be made available. I found myself constantly thirsty and having to go back to the galley to ask for water. All in all, I wouldn't fly with BA again using their long-haul services unless I were to fly in Business or First. The ground service is terrible.

As for the cabin crew this new Mixed Fleet with their Thunderbird Hats are very inferior compared to the cabin crew on the old contracts. At least experienced cabin crew would sort something out in the galley to at least compensate for the lack of food choice even if it is cheese and crackers. This crew do not offer anything and were nowhere to be seen once they did their meal service.

We have always chosen British Airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now it's on par or lower than other low cost carriers. Firstly we didn't get any priority boarding with our two young children. EasyJet provides this. Secondly, we reserved seats as travelling with our two children, they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows. On boarding we were told the plane has changed, therefore we now had assigned seats. Thirdly, after paying over £10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife I needed the loo, first class was out of bounds. So the only option the rear of the plane, however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past (I guess those drinks they were selling had the BA executive team seeing many ££££ so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority). After a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past, but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane. A crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea. Our flight from Heathrow to Bergen was only an hour and 40, but I spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member. The return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology. The safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off, the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof, asked the crew - ""Cabin crew, seats for landing"". The captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight, even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with 'that landing'. All minor points, but they were the points we enjoyed with BA, points that made us choose them, small points that made the difference. The pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them, the cabin crew that always went over and beyond.

The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers.

I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace.

Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update!

If they do how can they go on providing a service that is so bad? We arrived in Toronto on 9th September to be told our luggage had been left at Heathrow along with 80 other bags. They were well prepared at Toronto to deal with us having been forwarned of the problem - after filling in the relevant forms we were informed that our bags would be with us in 24 hours, nut it was 2.5 days later when we were finally reunited with them. British Airways should investiage the company they use in Toronto as they were extremely rude when we telephone to enquire when they thought the bags would be delivered, even hanging up on the Hotel Manager who tried to help us. Only after my Husband asked where they were and said he would collect the bags himself did we get an answer, and then it took until 9.00 p.m. on the Friday to be delivered. The final straw was having paid extra for two seats together by the window on the return journey, we found out upon checking in that we could not have these seats and we had to sit in a row of 4 - not a problem normally. but it had cost £90.00 extra to book these seats, and not one of the staff was interested, just a take or leave it attitude.

Check in was a bit disorganised as the check in for business class had a problem with the computer so this caused a delay. Security was a bit slow (no fast track). Business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor, note this is not a BA lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a local partner. Boarding was a disaster, we were called to board but then waited on the air-bridge for over 20 minutes. The air-bridge was made of glass and was full of people and it soon became very uncomfortable as there was no AC or ventilation and some people seemed close to passing out. Eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane (apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy). There was no communication from the ground staff, which although not BA staff reflects badly on the airline. Once we were finally on-board the flight was trouble free. Good service. Hot meals served but the pasta we chose was not very pleasant.

What I cannot understand is why they still have not updated their Club World seating after so many years. Even the US carriers offer superior seating these days. I don't get it - new British Airways plane but same old seats. While they are fully flat and I slept well, the main issues are having to step over other passengers as there is no direct aisle access and a lack of storage space and cubby holes around the seat. The cabin crew were mature, professional, and the CSD introduced himself during the flight and seemed genuine. Catering seems to have improved - I chose the beef for dinner and instead of the usual overcooked lump in a casserole dish it was cooked well and plated similar to what all first rate airlines do in Business class these days.

Somehow the seats are really narrow, so that anyone with remotely broad shoulders spills over onto the seats next to them. I couldn't fit between a larger man one one side and a woman on the other and resorted to leaning forward for much of the flight. Thankfully a child was on one side on the way back. There were a number of flyers on the plane who had clearly done the route before as many refused to sit togther, forcing first-time flyers on the route like me to be squashed between them. The seats were also incredibly uncomfortable. The moulding on the back was took narrow and dug into my bag. I only fell asleep through sheer exhaustion, but woke up repeatedly with back pain from the seat. Other passengers walked around the cabin throughout the flight, while some resorted to sitting in the flight attendants' seats. Also the seats in front of the toilets don't fully recline. The TV controls are fixed into the arm rests which makes them uncomfortable to put your arm on and you inevitably press one of the buttons accidentally. The TVs themselves are about 30 years old, small and poor quality. The selection of movies was not great. It was very hot onboard the plane, and passengers repeatedly asked for the air conditioning to be turned up. The service was good on the way out, but the return flight service was poor. The staff appeared disinterested. One flight attendant responded rudely to me when I asked if I could use the overhead locker above my seat that had her bag in it. Another told the child next to me, when he asked for Sprite with his dinner, they had run out. Even though I saw a flight attendant drinking a can of Sprite 30 minutes later. Generally they seemed more interested in rushing through the service and stuffing their mouths than helping anyone. My call button was ignored twice.

We were then advised shortly after by SMS that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to London Heathrow. This was not a lot of good when our car was parked at Gatwick. I managed to get through to BA and was given a new booking to Gatwick also the following day. We were offered no other assistance by the airline. The following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. Having eventually boarded the aircraft, we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at Barcelona airport. Shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours, so we would be given water. This was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was served. The real horror of this flight, however, was British Airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/Avios. This simply does not work. After one hour in the air, the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. Eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. About 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps (potato chips). He returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can, which we duly shared between us. Having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours, this was the only refreshment we could obtain.

First meal service has Thai Green Curry (veg) and the second Thai Red Curry (chicken). Really? No one could come up with two Thai dishes that were a little bit more different? So the meal service begins and I was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns. Unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns.  I said, ""I don't want the prawns for starter as I'm having the prawn main meal."" I should not have worried as the prawn salad was off.  Ok so prawns for starter and I'll have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, mushroom, spinach and tomato. Well I'm not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point I wasn't eating them. The chicken breast was dry and I got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it. Mushrooms were very meh, tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible. The bread roll didn't win any prizes either. I just gave up and refused to eat it. Now when this was served I'd been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the FA was off too quickly. No problem, press the call bell. Which is reset before anyone comes. Press it again and think I'd better get on with eating my food. Eventually some one arrives and notices I'm not eating my main course and after I tell them it is disgusting I ask why no one has answered my call button. Obviously I'm just asked what did I want and I say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and I'll have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice. This does not appear for fifteen minutes. During that time I am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isn't going work for me. So a couple of hours later I'm a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where I find some quite pleasant snacks. Back at my seat I think I need a G&T with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin.

They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980!

I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them.

I went to claim my luggage at the carousel, I waited for hours till all the luggage had gone through and I couldn't find my luggage which had my wedding items in it, including my wedding dress. As you can imagine I was devastated, I had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issue. I spent the night at Abuja hoping that my luggage would come in with the flight arriving the next morning as only one BA flight arrives from Heathrow to Abuja each day. My luggage never arrived the next day. Myself and my husband had to spend a hideous amount of money purchasing emergency wedding items. The BA staff at the airport weren't helpful at all, they were all very rude and none of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggage was. My luggage finally arrived about 5 days after my wedding in a very bad shape. Up till this day, BA has refused to acknowledge my claims and they haven't refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them. BA ruined what was supposed to be the best day of my life and I have vowed to never fly with BA. ",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Abuja,December 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,,1.0,1.0,

Considering that the flight had been delayed 23 hours one would have though that cabin crew would have been more attentive. This is not to say they were in any way unprofessional they were just in a hurry to give you a drink and your meal. There after you barely saw them! Duty Free sped through the cabin faster than Usian Bolt and landing and immigration cards were handed out just before landing. I was part way through completing mine when I heard the ""Cabin Crew 10 minutes to landing"" announcement! The seat I was sat in had a broken IFE screen hinge and would swing back to the closed position. Fortunately the cabin was not full which is a first for this route! Sadly the seat I then chose also had an IFE issue too - a minor one but annoying nonetheless. Third time lucky and hussar! I must add that the choice of films were rather poor too. The food would have been good save what was on the main menu. It was a choice of Chickpea Tagine Chicken and African Stew. Which region of Africa did that stew pertain to be from lord knows.

Check in at BAH was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. BA uses the Dilmun lounge, which is basic but adequate. The flight from BAH to LHR was on a 777. The seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats, and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortable. When fully flat there is not much room, and people over 6 feet will struggle. There was hardly any storage space, and the IFE screen was very small and of poor quality. The food was very average (I had the carrot and pumpkin soup). Cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. The lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. The bathrooms in both the main BA lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. The quality of food in the lounge is average, though the wine and spirit selection is decent. The flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. Cabin crew were a bit better on this leg, though still disengaged. The food was of average quality, though the wine list, while small, was good. Overall, BA has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. The lounge is sub par, particularly when compared to the Qatar lounge in Doha, or even the Qantas / One World lounge in LAX. The business class ticket was reasonably cheap, though I can now see why.

On the flight to London FAs were not unpleasant but not overly active except for the required meal service and duty free sales. However additional drinks were handed out in the galley if requested. On the flight back a rather young crew was trying harder but was - quite untypically for BA - rather robotic in their actions and announcements. Again additional drinks were served if requested. Both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. I am really missing the older more comfortable BA seats. Flying with hand baggage only we used web check-in for the first flight and the check in kiosk for the flight back. Both worked efficiently. Boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE which again was quite busy but not overcrowded. The Lounge as such is acceptable but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. Food and drink seem to be more or less the same in all lounges in VIE including OS flagship lounge. BA’s Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 again a comfortable oasis of rest amid a busy airport. However this time (breakfast time) the food offerings were quite basic and drink wise even basics such as orange juice or tomato juice were not available. Hopefully just an off day. BA still uses T3 for its flights to VIE which I consider a huge benefit over using T5 which looks nice but tends to be a mess for passengers.

Check in was fine and although security was tight, we were airside just after 08.00. Before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at 09.00. After tea and toast we checked at 09.00 and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available 10.00. Obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed. The on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at 11.00. At this point I did venture down to the British Airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people, I gave up and sat down again. At 12.00 the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of 14.00. During all of this time I should add that at no time was any information (other than the screen) made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc. Despite numerous announcements from Easyjet and other airlines BA was conspicuous by its silence. We were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay. Apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced. Despite the rather cramped departure area, everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area. Eventually we boarded just after 14.30. When everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadn't been completed and a further delay was likely. We eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. Now I know 'stuff' happens but let's not forget that we were departing from one of BA's home airports and why they couldn't have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybody's guess. Various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from Gatwick being dumbed down by BA in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of Heathrow. I have no idea whether this is true or not but I would ask one question, if this flight had been a morning flight from Heathrow to JFK, would BA have found a solution quicker?

When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line.

Cabin Crew friendly enough but seemed tired in their service and no smile. Food was average and not anything to write home about. I felt I had to eat quickly as the flight attendant was waiting for me to finish my last bite with a stern look! Inflight entertainment was excellent and kept me entertained throughout the six hours you have got an array of movies TV games and Music to choose from. Seats were really comfy and I got a good kip.

1021,6.0,"""so much BA could do to improve""",Clive Drake,22nd December 2018,True,"Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish.

Uncomfortable hard very upright seats not even sure you can recline them. We sat in row 11 and on both outward and inbound flights the cabin temperature was far to hot and stuffy although it seemed to be an issue in just 4 rows as the front and back of the plane was much cooler. We both came off the return flight with bad headaches. The food was simply awful thank goodness we ate a proper breakfast before boarding as the minuscule roll and wrap was hardly enough to feed a child and on that topic the food was not suitable for a young toddler and there was no child option.

As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them.

I was pleasantly surprised (for my friend) that he was able to check-in his big carry-on for free while I paid for check-in luggage. I understood why in the end. My biggest gripe has to be that the Sunday flight departs and arrives late into LHR. This was worsened by the fact that it was a full flight but the overhead bins were already full before all were on board hence there was a 20 minute delay on the tarmac as remaining hand-carry luggage had to be put in the hold.

We had to run all the way through and almost missed the last Heathrow Express train. I will never fly a late flight into LHR again.

Only until this airline manage to update everything they offer, utilise (aircraft wise) and provide as much emphasis on their everyday economy folk as they do on their frequent fliers, I may consider them again.

Dinner was produced a short time into the flight and a snack provided before landing. The journey from JFK was worse. Same problem with rude and disdainful stewardess. We paid extra for extra legroom at the front of the cabin and found more seats had been installed in front which resulted in such short room that my knees were touching the seat in front for the whole trip back. when the seat in front was reclined it was impossible to view the monitor in front of me.

3654,1.0,British Airways customer review,C Tyler,18th May 2014,False,When we booked our holiday to Barbados I was really pleased to see we were flying with British Airways as they have a good reputation. Sadly our experiences put a lie to this. As part of the service they offer BA allow you to either pay an expensive premium to choose your seats in advance or you can log onto their website for free 24 hours in advance. I tried to do this several times without success and finally rang the helpline number suggested. After a 14 minute call at premium rate the call operator (whose grasp of English wasn't great) was unable to advise about the problem nor manually book our seats and could offer nothing more constructive than “keep trying”. I rang the complaints line (still premium rate) and other than a better grasp of English was still unable to assist in any way. Both operators assured me that they would sort it all at the Airport. So in view of this we arranged to arrive at the airport early. We entered our details online to find that even though there were only 2 of us we weren't sat together or even on the same row. By now my wife – who is a nervous flyer – was in tears! We then sought assistance and had to queue but eventually we're allocated 2 seats together. As they were free I don't know why these weren't given originally – however given our further experiences – maybe they don't like using them? I have flown long haul before and found that you always get a more generous allocation of space particularly shoulder and legroom. Sadly British Airways don't appear to follow this doctrine. The legroom was adequate however as soon as the woman in front reclined her seat I had about 4 inches between the front of my nose and the back of her seat. As my TV screen is in the back of this seat it made trying to watch the screen extremely difficult. I managed to watch 1 film however this brought on a headache so I was forced to stop. I would love to see what regulations BA have to follow regarding VDU viewing however in a work environment this would be banned without question. The final disappointment came when the food was distributed. I had the Thai Chicken which was over-cooked so that the rice was cremated to the top and bottom of the container whilst my wife had the cottage pie which tasted of plastic. She didn't eat hers. I ate mine but had a stomach upset for the following 48 hours. All in all this was an experience I do not want to repeat and I shall certainly not fly British Airways by choice in the future!

Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks.

A plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good. The prices were even below airport ones. The bad thing was indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the products (people were buying stuff) and it took ages until you could get your order - well, you can't compete with Ryanair trying to do better the things they do best.

I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately.

BA's service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight's experience really takes the biscuit. I should now be in Amsterdam - however, I am still writing this from London despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere. We boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. Shortly after, we were told that the routes north of LHR were shut, and no planes were taking off. About an hour into the ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. One more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. After 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later. We did then leave the gate, and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. We were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that AMS would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived, so our flight wad cancelled. We taxied back to the gate, where we waited a further 10-15 minutes for ground staff to become available. I must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very good. The crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and watered. This is the full extent of my praise though. Little was I to know that the real disaster was still to come. BA's ground handling was attrocious. We were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. However, BA had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthy. Vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because ""all the rooms were full"". I have never heard anything like it. This is beyond unbelievable. No assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situation. Further, the promised ""rebooking"" staff had all gone home - I was told to consult the BA app the following morning. BA's app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days total. The feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so I can replan my trip for another weekend, is broken. I guess I'll be trying out their call centre in the morning. This is all simply appalling. We all understand that adverse weather happens. But to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. Moreover, BA surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. Why they could not have prioritised the AMS flight over flights to 24-hour airports I do not know. And as for the ground handling, I have never had an experience this bad. BA staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to Heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the ""we don't work for BA excuse"". I've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn't have handled it better. By contrast, I don't see how BA could have handled this worse.

The same attendant appeared in the passport control hall and called out - without success unfortunately - looking for a passenger who had left his glasses behind. Food was absolutely fine and the Burgundy a little too drinkable. This was probably up there as one of the better flights I've taken - most are done under sufferance but this one was pretty good overall.,,Business Class,,,3.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,,4.0,4.0,
